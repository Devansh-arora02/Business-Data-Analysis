# Business Data Analysis
This capstone proejct was aimed at getting a field-work experience for the role of a Data Scientist. It included collecting, pre-processing and analyzing data for generating insightful results and further enhacing business strategies. It was a ride from fundamental descriptive analysis all the way upto generating ML models.
You can understand the flow of the project through this [Presentation](https://expanding-customer-base--hxzavct.gamma.site) which includes all the major insights and details on techniques used to derive those insights. A full fledged explanation of the project can be found in this [report](https://github.com/Devansh-arora02/Business-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Analysis%20Result.pdf).
